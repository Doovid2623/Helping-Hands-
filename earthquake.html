            <h1>Earthquakes</h1>
            <p>Earthquake, any sudden shaking of the ground caused by the passage of seismic waves through Earth’s rocks. Seismic waves are produced when some form of energy stored in Earth’s crust is suddenly released, usually when masses of rock straining against one another suddenly fracture and “slip.” Earthquakes occur most often along geologic faults, narrow zones where rock masses move in relation to one another. The major fault lines of the world are located at the fringes of the huge tectonic plates that make up Earth’s crust.</p>

            <h1>The structure of the Earth </h1>
            <p>Earthquakes are the result of sudden movement along faults within the Earth. The movement releases stored-up 'elastic strain ' energy in the form of seismic waves, which propagate through the Earth and cause the ground surface to shake. Such movement on the fault is generally a response to long-term deformation and the buildup of stress.</p>

            <h1>Plate tectonics</h1>
            <p>The Earth’s outermost layer is fragmented into about 15 major slabs called tectonic plates. These slabs form the lithosphere, which is comprised of the crust (continental and oceanic) and the upper part of the mantle. Tectonic plates move very slowly relative to each other, typically a few centimetres per year, but this still causes a huge amount of deformation at the plate boundaries, which in turn results in earthquakes.</p>

                <p>Evaluate your home’s earthquake resilience, and improve it through steps such as fastening down furniture and putting anti-shatter coatings on glass windows. Add sheathing which is a rigid building material that connects studs, joists, or rafters in your walls, floors, and ceilings. Any sheathing you add will improve structural stability and help resist excessive movement during an earthquake.</p>

                <h2>Stockpile water and foodstuffs</h2>
                <p>You should have at least three days’ worth of drinking water and foodstuffs stockpiled. You should also have radios and flashlights prepared. Preparing for an earthquake requires more than just stockpiling items. It is important to remember to prepare your house. All dressers, bookshelves, and TV stands should be anchored to the walls. Not only does that prepare damage to your items, but it also helps to reduce the chance that you or your family member is injured. If you don’t secure your bookshelf and your child is playing below it, an earthquake could have devastating results.</p>

                <p>Get to know the people in your community better by getting actively involved in community disaster training. These earthquake training resources are designed to help users obtain the knowledge, tools, and support that they need to plan and implement effective earthquake mitigation strategies. In addition to courses about responding or preparing to respond to earthquakes and other disasters, the EMI also provides hazard mitigation training. Mitigation courses show states and localities how to assess and reduce risks posed by earthquakes and other natural hazards, and how to obtain grant support from FEMA for hazard mitigation activities.</p>

                <h2>Keep vehicles off roads</h2>
                <p>It’s important to know how to stay safe while driving when the ground starts shaking. There is a chance that you might not feel a small earthquake in a moving car. If you happen to notice the cars around you stopping suddenly and people coming out of buildings, then it is time to slow your car down and come to a stop. In the event that you get caught in an earthquake while driving, an earthquake survival kit can come in handy. If you exit your car after an earthquake has subsided, it’s important to stay away from fallen trees and power lines. Aftershocks can still occur after a major earthquake, which can cause even more damage to the buildings and other fixtures around you.</p>
